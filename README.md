# Android-Application

This application was coded in Java & XML. Third-party libraries can be found inside Gradle file. Application is integrated with Firebase, which provides data storage & user authentication.

This mobile app provides users with a convenient and **efficient** **way** **to** **book** a hairdresser. Using the app, users can book an appointment with a hairdresser, register and log in to their account where they can see their previous and upcoming bookings, save their favourite branches and rate services. The app allows service providers (hairdressers) to create their profile for customers to book with them, manage their bookings and edit their profile.

Features of this application consist of **authentication**, **data** **storage**, **users** **interaction**, **system** & **profile** **personalization** and many others. App supports **SMS** **registration** and **login**, as well as standard, more secure forms of authentication like email and password. There are two types of userbases, normal and super user (client and hairdresser). As server-side mechanism, **Firebase** was integrated, which should provide if needed, additional **scalability**. App also supports Google-Maps API, as well other server-based products.

The app does not use any processor or graphics-intensive animations or calculations, so a powerful mobile phone is not required to get the full experience of the app. The mobile device must have the **Android** **operating** **system**, minimum version 9.0 (Pie), installed. The device must be connected to the internet for the app to work properly. To ensure full functionality of the system, the application must be granted permissions to access the location and photos of the device or the camera, as well as to send notifications and SMS. These permissions are not a prerequisite for use, but they are when making a reservation or registering as a business with specialised services.For the readability of the text, a minimum screen size of 320 x 480 pixels is recommended.
